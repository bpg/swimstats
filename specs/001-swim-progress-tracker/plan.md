# Implementation Plan: Swim Progress Tracker

**Branch**: `001-swim-progress-tracker` | **Date**: 2026-01-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-swim-progress-tracker/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a web application to track competitive swimming progress for a Canadian swimmer. The system records swim times organized by meets, calculates personal bests, compares against time standards (Swimming Canada, Swim Ontario), and visualizes progress over time. Course-centric organization (25m/50m) with OIDC authentication supporting full and view-only access levels.

**Technical Approach**: Modern SPA frontend with Go backend API, PostgreSQL persistence, containerized for Kubernetes deployment.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25+ (backend), TypeScript 5.x (frontend)
**Frontend Framework**: React 18 with Vite, TailwindCSS, React Query
**Backend Framework**: Go standard library + chi router, sqlc for type-safe SQL
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 16
**Authentication**: OIDC via Authentik (coreos/go-oidc library)
**Testing**: Go testing + testify (backend), Vitest + React Testing Library (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), Kubernetes
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Build/CI**: GitHub Actions, multi-stage Docker builds
**Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
**Performance Goals**: API p95 < 200ms reads, < 500ms writes; TTI < 3s; graphs render < 2s for 500 times
**Constraints**: < 250KB gzipped JS bundle; WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
**Scale/Scope**: Single swimmer (expandable), ~500 times, ~50 meets, ~10 standards

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Requirement | Plan Compliance | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| I. Code Quality | Linting, type safety, DRY, single responsibility | Go: golangci-lint, strict typing; TS: ESLint, strict mode | ✅ Pass |
| II. Test-Driven Development | Test-first, >90% coverage critical paths, unit/integration/contract tests | Go: table-driven tests, testify; React: Vitest, RTL; API contract tests | ✅ Pass |
| III. UX Consistency | Design system, WCAG 2.1 AA, responsive, loading states, error handling | TailwindCSS design tokens, accessible components, loading skeletons | ✅ Pass |
| IV. Performance | API p95 <200ms/<500ms, TTI <3s, <250KB bundle, no N+1 queries | sqlc prevents N+1, Vite code splitting, React Query caching | ✅ Pass |

**Quality Gates Compliance:**
- Lint: golangci-lint (Go), ESLint (TS) - CI blocking
- Type Check: Go compiler, TypeScript strict - CI blocking
- Unit Tests: go test, Vitest - CI blocking
- Integration Tests: testcontainers (Go), MSW (frontend) - CI blocking
- Accessibility: axe-core in CI - CI blocking for UI changes
- Code Review: GitHub branch protection - required

**Structure Decision**: Web application pattern (frontend + backend) selected due to:
- Separate deployment scaling for API vs static assets
- Go backend provides type safety and performance for API
- React SPA provides responsive, interactive UI for data entry and visualization
- Clear separation of concerns between data/logic (backend) and presentation (frontend)

## Implementation Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Setup | ✅ Complete | Project scaffolding, Docker, CI |
| Phase 2: Foundational | ✅ Complete | DB, Auth, Core UI, Test setup |
| Phase 3: US1 - Record Times | ✅ Complete | Full CRUD for swimmers, meets, times |
| Phase 4: US2 - Personal Bests | ✅ Complete | PB calculation, display, API |
| Phase 4b: All Times View | ✅ Complete | Event-based time history with PB badges |
| Phase 5: US3 - Standards | ⏳ Pending | |
| Phase 6: US4 - Compare | ⏳ Pending | |
| Phase 7: US5 - Progress Charts | ⏳ Pending | |
| Phase 8: US6 - Standing | ⏳ Pending | |
| Phase 9: Polish | ⏳ Pending | |

**Current State**: MVP (US1 + US2 + All Times) is complete and tested. App can:
- Create and manage swimmer profile
- Create and manage meets (with inline quick-add from time entry)
- Record swim times with batch entry
- View time history with filtering
- Filter by course type (25m/50m)
- View personal bests by stroke
- View all times per event with PB indicators and sorting (by date or time)

**Known Issues Resolved**:
- Base64 encoded `X-Mock-User` header to fix proxy errors
- Added Settings button to navigation
- Added swimmer profile editing to Settings page
- Fixed "Recent Meets0" / "Time History0" display bug (React rendering numeric 0)
- Fixed auth persistence (persist user object in localStorage)
- Fixed request ID generation (invalid characters in logging middleware)

**UX Enhancements**:
- Quick Add Meet: Create meets inline from time entry form (FR-037)
- Navigation reordering: Add Times before Meets

**Navigation Order**: Add Times → All Times → Personal Bests → Meets → Progress → Standards

## Complexity Tracking

No Constitution violations requiring justification. The architecture follows standard web application patterns with appropriate technology choices for each layer.
