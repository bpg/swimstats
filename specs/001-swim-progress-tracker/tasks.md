# Tasks: Swim Progress Tracker

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-swim-progress-tracker/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Included per Constitution Principle II (Test-Driven Development)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/` (Go 1.25+, chi router, sqlc)
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` (React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS)
- **Migrations**: `backend/migrations/`
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP, must complete first
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 (needs times to compute PBs)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational only - can parallel with US1/US2
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US2 + US3 (needs PBs and standards)
- **US5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 (needs times for charts)
- **US6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US4 (needs comparison logic)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

          Phase 9 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T002, T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel
- T008, T009, T010 can run in parallel

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T014, T015, T016 can run in parallel
- T019, T020, T021 can run in parallel
- T028, T029 can run in parallel
- T033, T034 can run in parallel
- T040, T041, T042 can run in parallel

**Within Each User Story**:
- All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All type definition tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- sqlc queries can be written in parallel before generation

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Auth, DB, Core)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 - Record Times
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 - Personal Bests
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: App can record times and show PBs
6. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

| Increment | Stories | Capability |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| MVP | US1 + US2 | Record times, view PBs |
| +Standards | US3 | Add/manage time standards |
| +Comparison | US4 | Compare against standards |
| +Charts | US5 | View progress graphs |
| +Dashboard | US6 | Qualification standing view |

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Phases 1-4 (Setup, Foundation, US1, US2)
- Authentication working
- Can record swimmer profile
- Can create meets and enter times
- Can view personal bests
- Course filtering works

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Constitution requires TDD - write tests first, verify they fail
- Constitution requires >90% coverage on critical paths
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- US7 (Historical Import) is P4/Future - not included in initial scope
