# SwimStats Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence

All code contributions MUST adhere to consistent quality standards that ensure
maintainability, readability, and long-term sustainability of the codebase.

- **Readability**: Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming conventions;
  comments are reserved for explaining "why," not "what"
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, and function MUST have one
  well-defined purpose
- **DRY Compliance**: Duplicated logic MUST be extracted into reusable
  components; copy-paste code is prohibited
- **Linting Enforcement**: All code MUST pass configured linters with zero
  warnings before merge
- **Type Safety**: Explicit typing MUST be used where supported by the language;
  `any` types are prohibited except with documented justification

**Rationale**: Consistent code quality reduces cognitive load during reviews,
accelerates onboarding, and minimizes technical debt accumulation.

### II. Test-Driven Development

Tests are not optional artifacts—they are the specification that drives
implementation. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory for all features.

- **Test-First**: Tests MUST be written before implementation; PRs without
  corresponding tests for new functionality will be rejected
- **Coverage Thresholds**: New code MUST maintain or improve overall test
  coverage; critical paths require >90% coverage
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Isolated logic validation (MUST exist for all services)
  - **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction (MUST exist for APIs)
  - **Contract Tests**: External interface guarantees (MUST exist for public APIs)
- **Test Independence**: Each test MUST be runnable in isolation without
  depending on other tests or external state
- **Failure Verification**: Tests MUST demonstrably fail before implementation
  proves them correct

**Rationale**: TDD catches defects early, serves as living documentation, and
enables confident refactoring without regression fear.

### III. User Experience Consistency

Every user-facing interface MUST deliver a cohesive, predictable, and accessible
experience that reflects SwimStats brand standards.

- **Design System Adherence**: All UI components MUST use established design
  tokens (colors, typography, spacing); custom styles require approval
- **Interaction Patterns**: Common actions (navigation, forms, feedback) MUST
  follow documented UX patterns consistently across all views
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All interfaces MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards;
  keyboard navigation and screen reader support are non-negotiable
- **Responsive Behavior**: Layouts MUST function correctly across defined
  breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Loading States**: All async operations MUST display appropriate loading
  indicators; users MUST never see blank screens during data fetch
- **Error Communication**: Error messages MUST be user-friendly, actionable,
  and never expose technical details to end users

**Rationale**: Consistent UX builds user trust, reduces support burden, and
differentiates SwimStats through quality of experience.

### IV. Performance Standards

Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. All code MUST meet defined
performance budgets and degrade gracefully under load.

- **Response Time Targets**:
  - API endpoints: p95 < 200ms for read operations, p95 < 500ms for writes
  - Page load: Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3 seconds on 4G connection
  - UI interactions: < 100ms feedback for user actions
- **Resource Budgets**:
  - JavaScript bundle: < 250KB gzipped for initial load
  - Memory: No memory leaks; stable usage under sustained operation
  - Database queries: No N+1 patterns; all queries MUST be optimized with indexes
- **Scalability Requirements**: System MUST handle 10x current load without
  architectural changes
- **Monitoring Obligation**: All production code MUST emit performance metrics;
  degradations trigger alerts
- **Performance Testing**: Load tests MUST validate performance targets before
  release of performance-sensitive features

**Rationale**: Poor performance directly impacts user retention and system
reliability; proactive budgets prevent gradual degradation.

## Quality Gates

All contributions MUST pass the following gates before merge:

| Gate | Requirement | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Lint | Zero errors, zero warnings | CI blocking |
| Type Check | Full type coverage, no suppressions without justification | CI blocking |
| Unit Tests | All pass, coverage threshold met | CI blocking |
| Integration Tests | All pass for affected components | CI blocking |
| Performance | No regression beyond 10% on benchmarks | CI warning, manual review |
| Accessibility | aXe/Lighthouse audit pass | CI blocking for UI changes |
| Code Review | Minimum 1 approval from code owner | GitHub branch protection |

**Exceptions**: Gate bypasses require documented justification in PR description
and explicit approval from a maintainer. All bypasses are logged and reviewed
in retrospectives.

## Development Workflow

### Pull Request Requirement

**All changes to the codebase MUST be submitted via Pull Requests.** Direct commits
to any branch are prohibited. This applies to all contributors regardless of role.

- No exceptions for "small fixes" or "trivial changes"
- Emergency hotfixes still require PRs (expedited review permitted)
- Automated updates (e.g., Renovate) are submitted as PRs

**Rationale**: PRs ensure all changes are reviewed, tested by CI, and tracked in
project history with proper context.

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code; direct pushes prohibited
- `feature/*`: Individual features; branch from and merge to `main`
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes; branch from and merge to `main`
- `release/*`: Release preparation; created from `main` when stabilizing

### AI Assistant Guidelines

When Claude Code or other AI assistants work on this codebase, they MUST follow these rules:

- **Never commit to main**: AI assistants MUST NOT commit directly to the `main` branch.
  All work MUST be done on feature or fix branches.
- **Always create a new branch**: When starting work on a new feature or fix, AI assistants
  MUST create an appropriately named branch (`feature/*` or `fix/*`) before making any commits.
- **Verify quality gates before PR**: AI assistants MUST run all checks and tests locally
  and ensure they pass BEFORE creating a Pull Request. This includes:
  - Frontend: `cd frontend && make check && npm test -- --run` (lint, format, typecheck, tests)
  - Backend: `cd backend && golangci-lint run && go test ./...`
  PRs with failing CI are considered defects in the AI assistant's work.
- **Push and create PRs when done**: AI assistants MAY push branches and create Pull Requests
  when work is complete, to streamline the workflow.
- **Never merge PRs**: AI assistants MUST NOT merge Pull Requests. Merging is the sole
  responsibility of human maintainers who provide final review and approval.

**Rationale**: These constraints ensure human oversight of all code changes entering the
main branch while allowing AI assistants to complete the development workflow up to the
point of final approval. Pre-PR verification prevents wasted CI cycles and reviewer time.

### Commit Standards

Commits MUST follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
format. This is **mandatory** because the automated release process uses commit messages
to generate changelogs and determine version bumps.

- **Format**: `type(scope): description`
- **Types** (with release impact):
  - `feat`: New feature → triggers **minor** version bump, appears in "Features" section
  - `fix`: Bug fix → triggers **patch** version bump, appears in "Bug Fixes" section
  - `perf`: Performance improvement → triggers **patch** version bump, appears in "Performance" section
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks → no version bump, appears in "Miscellaneous" section
  - `style`: Code style changes → no version bump, excluded from changelog
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring → no version bump, excluded from changelog
  - `test`: Test additions/changes → no version bump, excluded from changelog
- **Note**: Use `chore(docs):` for documentation changes so they appear in "Miscellaneous"
- **Breaking Changes**: Add `!` after type or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer
  to trigger a **major** version bump (e.g., `feat!: remove deprecated API`)
- Each commit MUST represent a single logical change
- Commit messages MUST be descriptive; "fix bug" or "update" are prohibited

**Examples**:
```
feat(api): add endpoint for bulk time import
fix(frontend): correct date picker timezone handling
perf(db): add index for swimmer lookup queries
chore(ci): update GitHub Actions versions
chore(docs): update README badges
feat!: change authentication to require OIDC
```

### Code Review Requirements

- All PRs require at least one approval before merge
- Reviewers MUST verify alignment with Constitution principles
- Authors MUST respond to all review comments before re-requesting review
- Stale PRs (>7 days without activity) are subject to closure

### Definition of Done

A feature is complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria from spec are met
2. All quality gates pass
3. Documentation is updated (if applicable)
4. Performance targets are verified
5. Accessibility requirements are validated
6. Code review is approved

### Data Portability Requirements

The export/import functionality enables users to back up and restore their data.
Maintaining this capability across schema changes is critical for data integrity.

**Schema Evolution Checklist**

When modifying the database schema (adding, removing, or changing fields), you MUST:

1. **Update Export Types** (`backend/internal/domain/exporter/types.go`):
   - Add new fields to the appropriate export struct
   - Update field documentation with format requirements

2. **Update Export Service** (`backend/internal/domain/exporter/service.go`):
   - Populate new fields when building export data
   - Ensure the field is included in the export JSON

3. **Update Import Types** (`backend/internal/domain/importer/types.go`):
   - Add new fields to the appropriate import struct
   - Mark optional fields with `omitempty` for backward compatibility

4. **Update Import Service** (`backend/internal/domain/importer/service.go`):
   - Parse and validate new fields
   - Pass new fields to domain services for persistence

5. **Update Integration Tests** (`backend/tests/integration/export_test.go`):
   - Add the new field to test type definitions
   - Verify the field in the roundtrip test (export → clean → import → export)
   - Ensure the field value is preserved through the cycle

6. **Consider Format Versioning**:
   - The export format includes a `format_version` field (currently "1.0")
   - Increment version for breaking changes that require migration logic
   - Add migration code if old exports need to be upgraded

**Rationale**: Export/import is the user's safety net. Schema changes that break
export/import silently corrupt backups, which may not be discovered until the
user needs to restore their data—the worst possible time.

### Release Process

Releases are automated using [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
The process is driven entirely by conventional commit messages.

**How it works**:

1. **Accumulate Changes**: Merge PRs to `main` with conventional commit messages
2. **Release PR**: release-please automatically creates/updates a "Release PR" that:
   - Aggregates all changes since the last release
   - Generates a changelog grouped by commit type
   - Bumps the version based on commit types (feat→minor, fix→patch, breaking→major)
3. **Create Release**: When the Release PR is merged:
   - A GitHub Release is created with the changelog
   - A version tag is created (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
   - Docker images are built and tagged with the version

**Version Tracking**:
- Current version is tracked in `.release-please-manifest.json`
- Changelog is maintained in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Configuration is in `release-please-config.json`

**Docker Image Tags** (on release):
- `ghcr.io/bpg/swimstats/backend:0.2.0` - exact version
- `ghcr.io/bpg/swimstats/backend:0.2` - minor version (latest patch)
- `ghcr.io/bpg/swimstats/backend:latest` - most recent release

**Important**: The quality of releases depends entirely on commit message discipline.
Poorly written commit messages result in unclear changelogs.

## Governance

This Constitution is the authoritative source for SwimStats development
standards. All other documentation, practices, and decisions are subordinate.

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Submit amendment as PR to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
2. **Discussion**: Minimum 3-day comment period for non-trivial changes
3. **Approval**: Requires approval from at least 2 maintainers
4. **Versioning**: Bump version according to semantic rules:
   - MAJOR: Principle removal or incompatible redefinition
   - MINOR: New principle or significant guidance expansion
   - PATCH: Clarifications, typo fixes, non-semantic changes
5. **Propagation**: Verify all dependent templates remain aligned

### Compliance Verification

- All PRs MUST include Constitution compliance verification in review checklist
- Quarterly audits assess adherence across the codebase
- Violations discovered post-merge MUST be remediated within one sprint

### Conflict Resolution

When Constitution principles conflict with external requirements:

1. Document the conflict explicitly
2. Propose a scoped exception with expiration date
3. Obtain maintainer approval for the exception
4. Track exception in project backlog for future resolution

**Version**: 1.5.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-17 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-26
