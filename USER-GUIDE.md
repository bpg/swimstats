- Seconds: `30.12`
- Minutes:Seconds: `1:07.45`
- Hours:Minutes:Seconds: `1:02:34.56` (for distance events)

**New PB Notification**: After saving, you'll see which times are new personal bests.

### Quick Add Meet

Don't see your meet in the list? Create one inline:

1. Click "Or add a new meet"
2. Fill in the meet details:

## Tips & Best Practices

### Recording Times Efficiently

1. **Use Quick Entry**: Enter all times from a meet in one session
2. **Add Notes**: Record lane, heat, placement, or conditions
3. **Import Historical Data**: Use the import feature for bulk data

### Tracking Progress

1. **Check Progress Charts**: Review weekly/monthly to see trends
2. **Set Standard Goals**: Choose target standards to work toward
3. **Monitor "Almost" Times**: Focus training on events close to standards

### Data Management

1. **Export Regularly**: Create backups after adding significant data
2. **Separate by Season**: Consider separate import files for each season
3. **Keep Course Types Separate**: Don't mix 25m and 50m data in imports

---

## Keyboard Navigation

SwimStats supports keyboard navigation:

- **Tab**: Move between interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close dialogs and dropdowns

---

## Troubleshooting

### Times Not Showing

- Check the course type filter (25m vs 50m)
- Verify the meet's course type matches your filter

### Can't Add Duplicate Event

This is intentional. Each meet can only have one time per event. To update a time:
1. Go to the meet details page
2. Delete the existing time
3. Add the new time

### Import Failed

- Validate your JSON file syntax
- Check that dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ensure event codes are valid (e.g., "50FR", not "50 Freestyle")
- See [IMPORT-GUIDE.md](IMPORT-GUIDE.md) for troubleshooting tips

### Chart Not Loading

- Ensure you have times recorded for the selected event
- Check that the date range includes your times
- Try selecting a different course type
